(godoc-to-GitHub-MarkDown) generates package documentation in
GitHub flavoured Markdown.

Usage:

	godoc2ghmd [options] [full package name]

For full and up-to-date Usage information run:

	$ godoc2ghmd -help

### Notes
While the output of godoc2ghmd can simply be piped into a file, e.g.:

	$ godoc2ghmd github.com/GandalfUK/godoc2ghmd > README.md

it can also be used with the -file option:

	$ godoc2ghmd -file=README.md github.com/GandalfUK/godoc2ghmd

This invocation is particularly useful when using `go generate` to automate
the creation of package documentation before sumbmitting code. For
example, this directive:

go:generate godoc2ghmd -file=README.md github.com/GandalfUK/godoc2ghmd

in the  `documentation.go` file within this repositoy created this very
`README.md` file by running:

	$ go generate

The same command also (re)generates all the documentation in the examples
folder via other similar directives.

### History
This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md">https://github.com/davecheney/godoc2md</a> with (most of) the
changes from <a href="https://github.com/wdamron/godoc2gh">https://github.com/wdamron/godoc2gh</a> rolled in. I have then
made some additional fixes and modifications. (I have changed the repo name
only to make it easier to work on these changes while keeping the previous
versions intact for comparison).
