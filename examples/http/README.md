## <a name="pkg-overview">Overview</a>
Package http provides HTTP client and server implementations.

Get, Head, Post, and PostForm make HTTP (or HTTPS) requests:

	resp, err := http.Get("<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>")
	...
	resp, err := http.Post("<a href="http://example.com/upload">http://example.com/upload</a>", "image/jpeg", &buf)
	...
	resp, err := http.PostForm("<a href="http://example.com/form">http://example.com/form</a>",
		url.Values{"key": {"Value"}, "id": {"123"}})

The client must close the response body when finished with it:

	resp, err := http.Get("<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>")
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	// ...

For control over HTTP client headers, redirect policy, and other
settings, create a Client:

	client := &http.Client{
		CheckRedirect: redirectPolicyFunc,
	}
	
	resp, err := client.Get("<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>")
	// ...
	
	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>", nil)
	// ...
	req.Header.Add("If-None-Match", `W/"wyzzy"`)
	resp, err := client.Do(req)
	// ...

For control over proxies, TLS configuration, keep-alives,
compression, and other settings, create a Transport:

	tr := &http.Transport{
		MaxIdleConns:       10,
		IdleConnTimeout:    30 * time.Second,
		DisableCompression: true,
	}
	client := &http.Client{Transport: tr}
	resp, err := client.Get("<a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a>")

Clients and Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple
goroutines and for efficiency should only be created once and re-used.

ListenAndServe starts an HTTP server with a given address and handler.
The handler is usually nil, which means to use DefaultServeMux.
Handle and HandleFunc add handlers to DefaultServeMux:

	http.Handle("/foo", fooHandler)
	
	http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q", html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
	})
	
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))

More control over the server's behavior is available by creating a
custom Server:

	s := &http.Server{
		Addr:           ":8080",
		Handler:        myHandler,
		ReadTimeout:    10 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 << 20,
	}
	log.Fatal(s.ListenAndServe())

Starting with Go 1.6, the http package has transparent support for the
HTTP/2 protocol when using HTTPS. Programs that must disable HTTP/2
can do so by setting Transport.TLSNextProto (for clients) or
Server.TLSNextProto (for servers) to a non-nil, empty
map. Alternatively, the following GODEBUG environment variables are
currently supported:

	GODEBUG=http2client=0  # disable HTTP/2 client support
	GODEBUG=http2server=0  # disable HTTP/2 server support
	GODEBUG=http2debug=1   # enable verbose HTTP/2 debug logs
	GODEBUG=http2debug=2   # ... even more verbose, with frame dumps

The GODEBUG variables are not covered by Go's API compatibility
promise. Please report any issues before disabling HTTP/2
support: <a href="https://golang.org/s/http2bug">https://golang.org/s/http2bug</a>

The http package's Transport and Server both automatically enable
HTTP/2 support for simple configurations. To enable HTTP/2 for more
complex configurations, to use lower-level HTTP/2 features, or to use
a newer version of Go's http2 package, import "golang.org/x/net/http2"
directly and use its ConfigureTransport and/or ConfigureServer
functions. Manually configuring HTTP/2 via the golang.org/x/net/http2
package takes precedence over the net/http package's built-in HTTP/2
support.

HTTP status codes as registered with IANA.
See: <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml</a>

``` go
const DefaultMaxHeaderBytes = 1 << 20 // 1 MB

```
DefaultMaxHeaderBytes is the maximum permitted size of the headers
in an HTTP request.
This can be overridden by setting Server.MaxHeaderBytes.

``` go
const DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost = 2
```
DefaultMaxIdleConnsPerHost is the default value of Transport's
MaxIdleConnsPerHost.

``` go
const TimeFormat = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 GMT"
```
TimeFormat is the time format to use when generating times in HTTP
headers. It is like time.RFC1123 but hard-codes GMT as the time
zone. The time being formatted must be in UTC for Format to
generate the correct format.

For parsing this time format, see ParseTime.

``` go
const TrailerPrefix = "Trailer:"
```
TrailerPrefix is a magic prefix for ResponseWriter.Header map keys
that, if present, signals that the map entry is actually for
the response trailers, and not the response headers. The prefix
is stripped after the ServeHTTP call finishes and the values are
sent in the trailers.

This mechanism is intended only for trailers that are not known
prior to the headers being written. If the set of trailers is fixed
or known before the header is written, the normal Go trailers mechanism
is preferred:

    // declared.
    ErrContentLength = errors.New("http: wrote more than the declared Content-Length")

    // Deprecated: ErrWriteAfterFlush is no longer returned by
    // anything in the net/http package. Callers should not
    // compare errors against this variable.
    ErrWriteAfterFlush = errors.New("unused")
)
```
Errors used by the HTTP server.

``` go
var (
    // ServerContextKey is a context key. It can be used in HTTP
    // handlers with Context.Value to access the server that
    // started the handler. The associated value will be of
    // type *Server.
    ServerContextKey = &contextKey{"http-server"}

    // LocalAddrContextKey is a context key. It can be used in
    // HTTP handlers with Context.Value to access the local
    // address the connection arrived on.
    // The associated value will be of type net.Addr.
    LocalAddrContextKey = &contextKey{"local-addr"}
)
```
``` go
var DefaultClient = &Client{}
```
DefaultClient is the default Client and is used by Get, Head, and Post.

``` go
var DefaultServeMux = &defaultServeMux
```
DefaultServeMux is the default ServeMux used by Serve.

``` go
var ErrAbortHandler = errors.New("net/http: abort Handler")
```
ErrAbortHandler is a sentinel panic value to abort a handler.
While any panic from ServeHTTP aborts the response to the client,
panicking with ErrAbortHandler also suppresses logging of a stack
trace to the server's error log.

``` go
var ErrBodyReadAfterClose = errors.New("http: invalid Read on closed Body")
```
ErrBodyReadAfterClose is returned when reading a Request or Response
Body after the body has been closed. This typically happens when the body is
read after an HTTP Handler calls WriteHeader or Write on its
ResponseWriter.

``` go
var ErrHandlerTimeout = errors.New("http: Handler timeout")
```
ErrHandlerTimeout is returned on ResponseWriter Write calls
in handlers which have timed out.

``` go
var ErrLineTooLong = internal.ErrLineTooLong
```
ErrLineTooLong is returned when reading request or response bodies
with malformed chunked encoding.

``` go
var ErrMissingFile = errors.New("http: no such file")
```
ErrMissingFile is returned by FormFile when the provided file field name
is either not present in the request or not a file field.

``` go
var ErrNoCookie = errors.New("http: named cookie not present")
```
ErrNoCookie is returned by Request's Cookie method when a cookie is not found.

``` go
var ErrNoLocation = errors.New("http: no Location header in response")
```
ErrNoLocation is returned by Response's Location method
when no Location header is present.

``` go
var ErrServerClosed = errors.New("http: Server closed")
```
ErrServerClosed is returned by the Server's Serve, ServeTLS, ListenAndServe,
and ListenAndServeTLS methods after a call to Shutdown or Close.

``` go
var ErrSkipAltProtocol = errors.New("net/http: skip alternate protocol")
```
ErrSkipAltProtocol is a sentinel error value defined by Transport.RegisterProtocol.

``` go
var ErrUseLastResponse = errors.New("net/http: use last response")
```
ErrUseLastResponse can be returned by Client.CheckRedirect hooks to
control how redirects are processed. If returned, the next request
is not sent and the most recent response is returned with its body
unclosed.

``` go
var NoBody = noBody{}
```
NoBody is an io.ReadCloser with no bytes. Read always returns EOF
and Close always returns nil. It can be used in an outgoing client
request to explicitly signal that a request has zero bytes.
An alternative, however, is to simply set Request.Body to nil.

## <a name="CanonicalHeaderKey">func</a> [CanonicalHeaderKey](./header.go#L214)
``` go
func CanonicalHeaderKey(s string) string
```
CanonicalHeaderKey returns the canonical format of the
header key s. The canonicalization converts the first
letter and any letter following a hyphen to upper case;
the rest are converted to lowercase. For example, the
canonical key for "accept-encoding" is "Accept-Encoding".
If s contains a space or invalid header field bytes, it is
returned without modifications.

## <a name="DetectContentType">func</a> [DetectContentType](./sniff.go#L21)
``` go
func DetectContentType(data []byte) string
```
DetectContentType implements the algorithm described
at <a href="https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/">https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/</a> to determine the
Content-Type of the given data. It considers at most the
first 512 bytes of data. DetectContentType always returns
a valid MIME type: if it cannot determine a more specific one, it
returns "application/octet-stream".

## <a name="Error">func</a> [Error](./server.go#L2016)
``` go
func Error(w ResponseWriter, error string, code int)
```
Error replies to the request with the specified error message and HTTP code.
It does not otherwise end the request; the caller should ensure no further
writes are done to w.
The error message should be plain text.

## <a name="Handle">func</a> [Handle](./server.go#L2446)
``` go
func Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)
```
Handle registers the handler for the given pattern
in the DefaultServeMux.
The documentation for ServeMux explains how patterns are matched.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
package http_test
	
	import (
	    "fmt"
	    "log"
	    "net/http"
	    "sync"
	)
	
	type countHandler struct {
	    mu sync.Mutex // guards n
	    n  int
	}
	
	func (h *countHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	    h.mu.Lock()
	    defer h.mu.Unlock()
	    h.n++
	    fmt.Fprintf(w, "count is %d\n", h.n)
	}
	
	func ExampleHandle() {
	    http.Handle("/count", new(countHandler))
	    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
	}
```

</details>

## <a name="HandleFunc">func</a> [HandleFunc](./server.go#L2451)
``` go
func HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
```
HandleFunc registers the handler function for the given pattern
in the DefaultServeMux.
The documentation for ServeMux explains how patterns are matched.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
h1 := func(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
	    io.WriteString(w, "Hello from a HandleFunc #1!\n")
	}
	h2 := func(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
	    io.WriteString(w, "Hello from a HandleFunc #2!\n")
	}
	
	http.HandleFunc("/", h1)
	http.HandleFunc("/endpoint", h2)
	
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
```

</details>

## <a name="ListenAndServe">func</a> [ListenAndServe](./server.go#L3078)
``` go
func ListenAndServe(addr string, handler Handler) error
```
ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address addr and then calls
Serve with handler to handle requests on incoming connections.
Accepted connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

The handler is typically nil, in which case the DefaultServeMux is used.

ListenAndServe always returns a non-nil error.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
// Hello world, the web server
	
	helloHandler := func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	    io.WriteString(w, "Hello, world!\n")
	}
	
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", helloHandler)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
```

</details>

## <a name="ListenAndServeTLS">func</a> [ListenAndServeTLS](./server.go#L3088)
``` go
func ListenAndServeTLS(addr, certFile, keyFile string, handler Handler) error
```
ListenAndServeTLS acts identically to ListenAndServe, except that it
expects HTTPS connections. Additionally, files containing a certificate and
matching private key for the server must be provided. If the certificate
is signed by a certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation
of the server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	    io.WriteString(w, "Hello, TLS!\n")
	})
	
	// One can use generate_cert.go in crypto/tls to generate cert.pem and key.pem.
	log.Printf("About to listen on 8443. Go to https://127.0.0.1:8443/")
	err := http.ListenAndServeTLS(":8443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil)
	log.Fatal(err)
```

</details>

## <a name="MaxBytesReader">func</a> [MaxBytesReader](./request.go#L1110)
``` go
func MaxBytesReader(w ResponseWriter, r io.ReadCloser, n int64) io.ReadCloser
```
MaxBytesReader is similar to io.LimitReader but is intended for
limiting the size of incoming request bodies. In contrast to
io.LimitReader, MaxBytesReader's result is a ReadCloser, returns a
non-EOF error for a Read beyond the limit, and closes the
underlying reader when its Close method is called.

MaxBytesReader prevents clients from accidentally or maliciously
sending a large request and wasting server resources.

## <a name="NotFound">func</a> [NotFound](./server.go#L2024)
``` go
func NotFound(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
```
NotFound replies to the request with an HTTP 404 not found error.

## <a name="ParseHTTPVersion">func</a> [ParseHTTPVersion](./request.go#L768)
``` go
func ParseHTTPVersion(vers string) (major, minor int, ok bool)
```
ParseHTTPVersion parses a HTTP version string.
"HTTP/1.0" returns (1, 0, true).

## <a name="ParseTime">func</a> [ParseTime](./header.go#L111)
``` go
func ParseTime(text string) (t time.Time, err error)
```
ParseTime parses a time header (such as the Date: header),
trying each of the three formats allowed by HTTP/1.1:
TimeFormat, time.RFC850, and time.ANSIC.

## <a name="ProxyFromEnvironment">func</a> [ProxyFromEnvironment](./transport.go#L401)
``` go
func ProxyFromEnvironment(req *Request) (*url.URL, error)
```
ProxyFromEnvironment returns the URL of the proxy to use for a
given request, as indicated by the environment variables
HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
thereof). HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https
requests.

The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
"host[:port]", in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
An error is returned if the value is a different form.

A nil URL and nil error are returned if no proxy is defined in the
environment, or a proxy should not be used for the given request,
as defined by NO_PROXY.

As a special case, if req.URL.Host is "localhost" (with or without
a port number), then a nil URL and nil error will be returned.

## <a name="ProxyURL">func</a> [ProxyURL](./transport.go#L407)
``` go
func ProxyURL(fixedURL *url.URL) func(*Request) (*url.URL, error)
```
ProxyURL returns a proxy function (for use in a Transport)
that always returns the same URL.

## <a name="Redirect">func</a> [Redirect](./server.go#L2063)
``` go
func Redirect(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, url string, code int)
```
Redirect replies to the request with a redirect to url,
which may be a path relative to the request path.

The provided code should be in the 3xx range and is usually
StatusMovedPermanently, StatusFound or StatusSeeOther.

If the Content-Type header has not been set, Redirect sets it
to "text/html; charset=utf-8" and writes a small HTML body.
Setting the Content-Type header to any value, including nil,
disables that behavior.

## <a name="Serve">func</a> [Serve](./server.go#L2466)
``` go
func Serve(l net.Listener, handler Handler) error
```
Serve accepts incoming HTTP connections on the listener l,
creating a new service goroutine for each. The service goroutines
read requests and then call handler to reply to them.

The handler is typically nil, in which case the DefaultServeMux is used.

HTTP/2 support is only enabled if the Listener returns *tls.Conn
connections and they were configured with "h2" in the TLS
Config.NextProtos.

Serve always returns a non-nil error.

## <a name="ServeContent">func</a> [ServeContent](./fs.go#L153)
``` go
func ServeContent(w ResponseWriter, req *Request, name string, modtime time.Time, content io.ReadSeeker)
```
ServeContent replies to the request using the content in the
provided ReadSeeker. The main benefit of ServeContent over io.Copy
is that it handles Range requests properly, sets the MIME type, and
handles If-Match, If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since,
and If-Range requests.

If the response's Content-Type header is not set, ServeContent
first tries to deduce the type from name's file extension and,
if that fails, falls back to reading the first block of the content
and passing it to DetectContentType.
The name is otherwise unused; in particular it can be empty and is
never sent in the response.

If modtime is not the zero time or Unix epoch, ServeContent
includes it in a Last-Modified header in the response. If the
request includes an If-Modified-Since header, ServeContent uses
modtime to decide whether the content needs to be sent at all.

The content's Seek method must work: ServeContent uses
a seek to the end of the content to determine its size.

If the caller has set w's ETag header formatted per RFC 7232, section 2.3,
ServeContent uses it to handle requests using If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range.

Note that *os.File implements the io.ReadSeeker interface.

## <a name="ServeFile">func</a> [ServeFile](./fs.go#L672)
``` go
func ServeFile(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, name string)
```
ServeFile replies to the request with the contents of the named
file or directory.

If the provided file or directory name is a relative path, it is
interpreted relative to the current directory and may ascend to
parent directories. If the provided name is constructed from user
input, it should be sanitized before calling ServeFile.

As a precaution, ServeFile will reject requests where r.URL.Path
contains a ".." path element; this protects against callers who
might unsafely use filepath.Join on r.URL.Path without sanitizing
it and then use that filepath.Join result as the name argument.

As another special case, ServeFile redirects any request where r.URL.Path
ends in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final
"index.html". To avoid such redirects either modify the path or
use ServeContent.

Outside of those two special cases, ServeFile does not use
r.URL.Path for selecting the file or directory to serve; only the
file or directory provided in the name argument is used.

## <a name="ServeTLS">func</a> [ServeTLS](./server.go#L2483)
``` go
func ServeTLS(l net.Listener, handler Handler, certFile, keyFile string) error
```
ServeTLS accepts incoming HTTPS connections on the listener l,
creating a new service goroutine for each. The service goroutines
read requests and then call handler to reply to them.

The handler is typically nil, in which case the DefaultServeMux is used.

Additionally, files containing a certificate and matching private key
for the server must be provided. If the certificate is signed by a
certificate authority, the certFile should be the concatenation
of the server's certificate, any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

ServeTLS always returns a non-nil error.

## <a name="SetCookie">func</a> [SetCookie](./cookie.go#L160)
``` go
func SetCookie(w ResponseWriter, cookie *Cookie)
```
SetCookie adds a Set-Cookie header to the provided ResponseWriter's headers.
The provided cookie must have a valid Name. Invalid cookies may be
silently dropped.

## <a name="StatusText">func</a> [StatusText](./status.go#L150)
``` go
func StatusText(code int) string
```
StatusText returns a text for the HTTP status code. It returns the empty
string if the code is unknown.

## <a name="Client">type</a> [Client](./client.go#L56-L105)
``` go
type Client struct {
    // Transport specifies the mechanism by which individual
    // HTTP requests are made.
    // If nil, DefaultTransport is used.
    Transport RoundTripper

    // CheckRedirect specifies the policy for handling redirects.
    // If CheckRedirect is not nil, the client calls it before
    // following an HTTP redirect. The arguments req and via are
    // the upcoming request and the requests made already, oldest
    // first. If CheckRedirect returns an error, the Client's Get
    // method returns both the previous Response (with its Body
    // closed) and CheckRedirect's error (wrapped in a url.Error)
    // instead of issuing the Request req.
    // As a special case, if CheckRedirect returns ErrUseLastResponse,
    // then the most recent response is returned with its body
    // unclosed, along with a nil error.
    //
    // If CheckRedirect is nil, the Client uses its default policy,
    // which is to stop after 10 consecutive requests.
    CheckRedirect func(req *Request, via []*Request) error

    // Jar specifies the cookie jar.
    //
    // The Jar is used to insert relevant cookies into every
    // outbound Request and is updated with the cookie values
    // of every inbound Response. The Jar is consulted for every
    // redirect that the Client follows.
    //
    // If Jar is nil, cookies are only sent if they are explicitly
    // set on the Request.
    Jar CookieJar

    // Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this
    // Client. The timeout includes connection time, any
    // redirects, and reading the response body. The timer remains
    // running after Get, Head, Post, or Do return and will
    // interrupt reading of the Response.Body.
    //
    // A Timeout of zero means no timeout.
    //
    // The Client cancels requests to the underlying Transport
    // as if the Request's Context ended.
    //
    // For compatibility, the Client will also use the deprecated
    // CancelRequest method on Transport if found. New
    // RoundTripper implementations should use the Request's Context
    // for cancellation instead of implementing CancelRequest.
    Timeout time.Duration
}

```
A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a
usable client that uses DefaultTransport.

The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as
needed. Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)
and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and
redirects.

When following redirects, the Client will forward all headers set on the
initial Request except:

• when forwarding sensitive headers like "Authorization",
"WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie" to untrusted targets.
These headers will be ignored when following a redirect to a domain
that is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain.
For example, a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or "sub.foo.com"
will forward the sensitive headers, but a redirect to "bar.com" will not.

• when forwarding the "Cookie" header with a non-nil cookie Jar.
Since each redirect may mutate the state of the cookie jar,
a redirect may possibly alter a cookie set in the initial request.
When forwarding the "Cookie" header, any mutated cookies will be omitted,
with the expectation that the Jar will insert those mutated cookies
with the updated values (assuming the origin matches).
If Jar is nil, the initial cookies are forwarded without change.

### <a name="Client.CloseIdleConnections">func</a> (\*Client) [CloseIdleConnections](./client.go#L843)
``` go
func (c *Client) CloseIdleConnections()
```
CloseIdleConnections closes any connections on its Transport which
were previously connected from previous requests but are now
sitting idle in a "keep-alive" state. It does not interrupt any
connections currently in use.

If the Client's Transport does not have a CloseIdleConnections method
then this method does nothing.

### <a name="Client.Do">func</a> (\*Client) [Do](./client.go#L508)
``` go
func (c *Client) Do(req *Request) (*Response, error)
```
Do sends an HTTP request and returns an HTTP response, following
policy (such as redirects, cookies, auth) as configured on the
client.

An error is returned if caused by client policy (such as
CheckRedirect), or failure to speak HTTP (such as a network
connectivity problem). A non-2xx status code doesn't cause an
error.

If the returned error is nil, the Response will contain a non-nil
Body which the user is expected to close. If the Body is not both
read to EOF and closed, the Client's underlying RoundTripper
(typically Transport) may not be able to re-use a persistent TCP
connection to the server for a subsequent "keep-alive" request.

The request Body, if non-nil, will be closed by the underlying
Transport, even on errors.

On error, any Response can be ignored. A non-nil Response with a
non-nil error only occurs when CheckRedirect fails, and even then
the returned Response.Body is already closed.

Generally Get, Post, or PostForm will be used instead of Do.

If the server replies with a redirect, the Client first uses the
CheckRedirect function to determine whether the redirect should be
followed. If permitted, a 301, 302, or 303 redirect causes
subsequent requests to use HTTP method GET
(or HEAD if the original request was HEAD), with no body.
A 307 or 308 redirect preserves the original HTTP method and body,
provided that the Request.GetBody function is defined.
The NewRequest function automatically sets GetBody for common
standard library body types.

Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error
value's Timeout method will report true if request timed out or was
canceled.

### <a name="Client.Get">func</a> (\*Client) [Get](./client.go#L393)
``` go
func (c *Client) Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect after calling the
Client's CheckRedirect function:

	301 (Moved Permanently)
	302 (Found)
	303 (See Other)
	307 (Temporary Redirect)
	308 (Permanent Redirect)

An error is returned if the Client's CheckRedirect function fails
or if there was an HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't
cause an error. Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The
url.Error value's Timeout method will report true if request timed
out or was canceled.

When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

### <a name="Client.Head">func</a> (\*Client) [Head](./client.go#L828)
``` go
func (c *Client) Head(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Head issues a HEAD to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
following redirect codes, Head follows the redirect after calling the
Client's CheckRedirect function:

	301 (Moved Permanently)
	302 (Found)
	303 (See Other)
	307 (Temporary Redirect)
	308 (Permanent Redirect)

### <a name="Client.Post">func</a> (\*Client) [Post](./client.go#L763)
``` go
func (c *Client) Post(url, contentType string, body io.Reader) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Post issues a POST to the specified URL.

Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

If the provided body is an io.Closer, it is closed after the
request.

To set custom headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects
are handled.

### <a name="Client.PostForm">func</a> (\*Client) [PostForm](./client.go#L800)
``` go
func (c *Client) PostForm(url string, data url.Values) (resp *Response, err error)
```
PostForm issues a POST to the specified URL,
with data's keys and values URL-encoded as the request body.

The Content-Type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
To set other headers, use NewRequest and Client.Do.

When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects
are handled.

## <a name="CloseNotifier">type</a> [CloseNotifier](./server.go#L210-L230)
``` go
type CloseNotifier interface {
    // CloseNotify returns a channel that receives at most a
    // single value (true) when the client connection has gone
    // away.
    //
    // CloseNotify may wait to notify until Request.Body has been
    // fully read.
    //
    // After the Handler has returned, there is no guarantee
    // that the channel receives a value.
    //
    // If the protocol is HTTP/1.1 and CloseNotify is called while
    // processing an idempotent request (such a GET) while
    // HTTP/1.1 pipelining is in use, the arrival of a subsequent
    // pipelined request may cause a value to be sent on the
    // returned channel. In practice HTTP/1.1 pipelining is not
    // enabled in browsers and not seen often in the wild. If this
    // is a problem, use HTTP/2 or only use CloseNotify on methods
    // such as POST.
    CloseNotify() <-chan bool
}
```
The CloseNotifier interface is implemented by ResponseWriters which
allow detecting when the underlying connection has gone away.

This mechanism can be used to cancel long operations on the server
if the client has disconnected before the response is ready.

Deprecated: the CloseNotifier interface predates Go's context package.
New code should use Request.Context instead.

## <a name="ConnState">type</a> [ConnState](./server.go#L2738)
``` go
type ConnState int
```
A ConnState represents the state of a client connection to a server.
It's used by the optional Server.ConnState hook.

``` go
const (
    // StateNew represents a new connection that is expected to
    // send a request immediately. Connections begin at this
    // state and then transition to either StateActive or
    // StateClosed.
    StateNew ConnState = iota

    // StateActive represents a connection that has read 1 or more
    // bytes of a request. The Server.ConnState hook for
    // StateActive fires before the request has entered a handler
    // and doesn't fire again until the request has been
    // handled. After the request is handled, the state
    // transitions to StateClosed, StateHijacked, or StateIdle.
    // For HTTP/2, StateActive fires on the transition from zero
    // to one active request, and only transitions away once all
    // active requests are complete. That means that ConnState
    // cannot be used to do per-request work; ConnState only notes
    // the overall state of the connection.
    StateActive

    // StateIdle represents a connection that has finished
    // handling a request and is in the keep-alive state, waiting
    // for a new request. Connections transition from StateIdle
    // to either StateActive or StateClosed.
    StateIdle

    // StateHijacked represents a hijacked connection.
    // This is a terminal state. It does not transition to StateClosed.
    StateHijacked

    // StateClosed represents a closed connection.
    // This is a terminal state. Hijacked connections do not
    // transition to StateClosed.
    StateClosed
)
```

### <a name="ConnState.String">func</a> (ConnState) [String](./server.go#L2784)
``` go
func (c ConnState) String() string
```

## <a name="Cookie">type</a> [Cookie](./cookie.go#L19-L37)
``` go
type Cookie struct {
    Name  string
    Value string

    Path       string    // optional
    Domain     string    // optional
    Expires    time.Time // optional
    RawExpires string    // for reading cookies only

    // MaxAge=0 means no 'Max-Age' attribute specified.
    // MaxAge<0 means delete cookie now, equivalently 'Max-Age: 0'
    // MaxAge>0 means Max-Age attribute present and given in seconds
    MaxAge   int
    Secure   bool
    HttpOnly bool
    SameSite SameSite
    Raw      string
    Unparsed []string // Raw text of unparsed attribute-value pairs
}

```
A Cookie represents an HTTP cookie as sent in the Set-Cookie header of an
HTTP response or the Cookie header of an HTTP request.

See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a> for details.

### <a name="Cookie.String">func</a> (\*Cookie) [String](./cookie.go#L170)
``` go
func (c *Cookie) String() string
```
String returns the serialization of the cookie for use in a Cookie
header (if only Name and Value are set) or a Set-Cookie response
header (if other fields are set).
If c is nil or c.Name is invalid, the empty string is returned.

## <a name="CookieJar">type</a> [CookieJar](./jar.go#L17-L27)
``` go
type CookieJar interface {
    // SetCookies handles the receipt of the cookies in a reply for the
    // given URL.  It may or may not choose to save the cookies, depending
    // on the jar's policy and implementation.
    SetCookies(u *url.URL, cookies []*Cookie)

    // Cookies returns the cookies to send in a request for the given URL.
    // It is up to the implementation to honor the standard cookie use
    // restrictions such as in RFC 6265.
    Cookies(u *url.URL) []*Cookie
}
```
A CookieJar manages storage and use of cookies in HTTP requests.

Implementations of CookieJar must be safe for concurrent use by multiple
goroutines.

The net/http/cookiejar package provides a CookieJar implementation.

## <a name="Dir">type</a> [Dir](./fs.go#L40)
``` go
type Dir string
```
A Dir implements FileSystem using the native file system restricted to a
specific directory tree.

While the FileSystem.Open method takes '/'-separated paths, a Dir's string
value is a filename on the native file system, not a URL, so it is separated
by filepath.Separator, which isn't necessarily '/'.

Note that Dir will allow access to files and directories starting with a
period, which could expose sensitive directories like a .git directory or
sensitive files like .htpasswd. To exclude files with a leading period,
remove the files/directories from the server or create a custom FileSystem
implementation.

An empty Dir is treated as ".".

### <a name="Dir.Open">func</a> (Dir) [Open](./fs.go#L68)
``` go
func (d Dir) Open(name string) (File, error)
```
Open implements FileSystem using os.Open, opening files for reading rooted
and relative to the directory d.

## <a name="File">type</a> [File](./fs.go#L95-L101)
``` go
type File interface {
    io.Closer
    io.Reader
    io.Seeker
    Readdir(count int) ([]os.FileInfo, error)
    Stat() (os.FileInfo, error)
}
```
A File is returned by a FileSystem's Open method and can be
served by the FileServer implementation.

The methods should behave the same as those on an *os.File.

## <a name="FileSystem">type</a> [FileSystem](./fs.go#L87-L89)
``` go
type FileSystem interface {
    Open(name string) (File, error)
}
```
A FileSystem implements access to a collection of named files.
The elements in a file path are separated by slash ('/', U+002F)
characters, regardless of host operating system convention.

## <a name="Flusher">type</a> [Flusher](./server.go#L167-L170)
``` go
type Flusher interface {
    // Flush sends any buffered data to the client.
    Flush()
}
```
The Flusher interface is implemented by ResponseWriters that allow
an HTTP handler to flush buffered data to the client.

The default HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 ResponseWriter implementations
support Flusher, but ResponseWriter wrappers may not. Handlers
should always test for this ability at runtime.

Note that even for ResponseWriters that support Flush,
if the client is connected through an HTTP proxy,
the buffered data may not reach the client until the response
completes.

## <a name="Handler">type</a> [Handler](./server.go#L85-L87)
``` go
type Handler interface {
    ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}
```
A Handler responds to an HTTP request.

ServeHTTP should write reply headers and data to the ResponseWriter
and then return. Returning signals that the request is finished; it
is not valid to use the ResponseWriter or read from the
Request.Body after or concurrently with the completion of the
ServeHTTP call.

Depending on the HTTP client software, HTTP protocol version, and
any intermediaries between the client and the Go server, it may not
be possible to read from the Request.Body after writing to the
ResponseWriter. Cautious handlers should read the Request.Body
first, and then reply.

Except for reading the body, handlers should not modify the
provided Request.

If ServeHTTP panics, the server (the caller of ServeHTTP) assumes
that the effect of the panic was isolated to the active request.
It recovers the panic, logs a stack trace to the server error log,
and either closes the network connection or sends an HTTP/2
RST_STREAM, depending on the HTTP protocol. To abort a handler so
the client sees an interrupted response but the server doesn't log
an error, panic with the value ErrAbortHandler.

### <a name="FileServer">func</a> [FileServer](./fs.go#L715)
``` go
func FileServer(root FileSystem) Handler
```
FileServer returns a handler that serves HTTP requests
with the contents of the file system rooted at root.

To use the operating system's file system implementation,
use http.Dir:

	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("/tmp")))

As a special case, the returned file server redirects any request
ending in "/index.html" to the same path, without the final
"index.html".

```

</details>
### <a name="NotFoundHandler">func</a> [NotFoundHandler](./server.go#L2028)
``` go
func NotFoundHandler() Handler

NotFoundHandler returns a simple request handler
that replies to each request with a ``404 page not found'' reply.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
	
	// Create sample handler to returns 404

	mux.Handle("/resources/people/", newPeopleHandler())
	
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux))
```

</details>
### <a name="RedirectHandler">func</a> [RedirectHandler](./server.go#L2153)
``` go
func RedirectHandler(url string, code int) Handler
```
RedirectHandler returns a request handler that redirects
each request it receives to the given url using the given
status code.

The provided code should be in the 3xx range and is usually
StatusMovedPermanently, StatusFound or StatusSeeOther.

### <a name="StripPrefix">func</a> [StripPrefix](./server.go#L2035)
``` go
func StripPrefix(prefix string, h Handler) Handler
```
StripPrefix returns a handler that serves HTTP requests
by removing the given prefix from the request URL's Path
and invoking the handler h. StripPrefix handles a
request for a path that doesn't begin with prefix by
replying with an HTTP 404 not found error.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
// To serve a directory on disk (/tmp) under an alternate URL
	// path (/tmpfiles/), use StripPrefix to modify the request
	// URL's path before the FileServer sees it:

```

</details>
### <a name="TimeoutHandler">func</a> [TimeoutHandler](./server.go#L3182)
``` go
func TimeoutHandler(h Handler, dt time.Duration, msg string) Handler
```
TimeoutHandler returns a Handler that runs h with the given time limit.

The new Handler calls h.ServeHTTP to handle each request, but if a
call runs for longer than its time limit, the handler responds with
a 503 Service Unavailable error and the given message in its body.
(If msg is empty, a suitable default message will be sent.)
After such a timeout, writes by h to its ResponseWriter will return
ErrHandlerTimeout.

TimeoutHandler supports the Flusher and Pusher interfaces but does not
support the Hijacker interface.

## <a name="HandlerFunc">type</a> [HandlerFunc](./server.go#L2003)
``` go
type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)
```
The HandlerFunc type is an adapter to allow the use of
ordinary functions as HTTP handlers. If f is a function
with the appropriate signature, HandlerFunc(f) is a
Handler that calls f.

### <a name="HandlerFunc.ServeHTTP">func</a> (HandlerFunc) [ServeHTTP](./server.go#L2006)
``` go
func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
```
ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).

## <a name="Header">type</a> [Header](./header.go#L21)
``` go
type Header map[string][]string
```
A Header represents the key-value pairs in an HTTP header.

The keys should be in canonical form, as returned by
CanonicalHeaderKey.

### <a name="Header.Add">func</a> (Header) [Add](./header.go#L27)
``` go
func (h Header) Add(key, value string)
```
Add adds the key, value pair to the header.
It appends to any existing values associated with key.
The key is case insensitive; it is canonicalized by
CanonicalHeaderKey.

### <a name="Header.Clone">func</a> (Header) [Clone](./header.go#L82)
``` go
func (h Header) Clone() Header
```
Clone returns a copy of h or nil if h is nil.

### <a name="Header.Del">func</a> (Header) [Del](./header.go#L68)
``` go
func (h Header) Del(key string)
```
Del deletes the values associated with key.
The key is case insensitive; it is canonicalized by
CanonicalHeaderKey.

### <a name="Header.Get">func</a> (Header) [Get](./header.go#L46)
``` go
func (h Header) Get(key string) string
```
Get gets the first value associated with the given key. If
there are no values associated with the key, Get returns "".
It is case insensitive; textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey is
used to canonicalize the provided key. To access multiple
values of a key, or to use non-canonical keys, access the
map directly.

### <a name="Header.Set">func</a> (Header) [Set](./header.go#L36)
``` go
func (h Header) Set(key, value string)
```
Set sets the header entries associated with key to the
single element value. It replaces any existing values
associated with key. The key is case insensitive; it is
canonicalized by textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey.
To use non-canonical keys, assign to the map directly.

### <a name="Header.Write">func</a> (Header) [Write](./header.go#L73)
``` go
func (h Header) Write(w io.Writer) error
```
Write writes a header in wire format.

### <a name="Header.WriteSubset">func</a> (Header) [WriteSubset](./header.go#L173)
``` go
func (h Header) WriteSubset(w io.Writer, exclude map[string]bool) error
```
WriteSubset writes a header in wire format.
If exclude is not nil, keys where exclude[key] == true are not written.

## <a name="Hijacker">type</a> [Hijacker](./server.go#L179-L200)
``` go
type Hijacker interface {
    // Hijack lets the caller take over the connection.
    // After a call to Hijack the HTTP server library
    // will not do anything else with the connection.
    //
    // It becomes the caller's responsibility to manage
    // and close the connection.
    //
    // The returned net.Conn may have read or write deadlines
    // already set, depending on the configuration of the
    // Server. It is the caller's responsibility to set
    // or clear those deadlines as needed.
    //
    // The returned bufio.Reader may contain unprocessed buffered
    // data from the client.
    //
    // After a call to Hijack, the original Request.Body must not
    // be used. The original Request's Context remains valid and
    // is not canceled until the Request's ServeHTTP method
    // returns.
    Hijack() (net.Conn, *bufio.ReadWriter, error)
}
```
The Hijacker interface is implemented by ResponseWriters that allow
an HTTP handler to take over the connection.

The default ResponseWriter for HTTP/1.x connections supports
Hijacker, but HTTP/2 connections intentionally do not.
ResponseWriter wrappers may also not support Hijacker. Handlers
should always test for this ability at runtime.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
http.HandleFunc("/hijack", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	    hj, ok := w.(http.Hijacker)
	    if !ok {
	        http.Error(w, "webserver doesn't support hijacking", http.StatusInternalServerError)
	        return
	    }
	    conn, bufrw, err := hj.Hijack()
	    if err != nil {
	        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
	        return
	    }
	    // Don't forget to close the connection:
	    defer conn.Close()
	    bufrw.WriteString("Now we're speaking raw TCP. Say hi: ")
	    bufrw.Flush()
	    s, err := bufrw.ReadString('\n')
	    if err != nil {
	        log.Printf("error reading string: %v", err)
	        return
	    }
	    fmt.Fprintf(bufrw, "You said: %q\nBye.\n", s)
	    bufrw.Flush()
	})
```

```
ProtocolError represents an HTTP protocol error.

Deprecated: Not all errors in the http package related to protocol errors
are of type ProtocolError.

### <a name="ProtocolError.Error">func</a> (\*ProtocolError) [Error](./request.go#L48)
``` go

    Method string

    // Header specifies additional promised request headers. This cannot
    // include HTTP/2 pseudo header fields like ":path" and ":scheme",
    // which will be added automatically.
    Header Header

```
PushOptions describes options for Pusher.Push.

## <a name="Pusher">type</a> [Pusher](./http.go#L130-L156)
``` go
type Pusher interface {
    // Push initiates an HTTP/2 server push. This constructs a synthetic
    // request using the given target and options, serializes that request
    // into a PUSH_PROMISE frame, then dispatches that request using the
    // server's request handler. If opts is nil, default options are used.
    //
    // The target must either be an absolute path (like "/path") or an absolute
    // URL that contains a valid host and the same scheme as the parent request.
    // If the target is a path, it will inherit the scheme and host of the
    // parent request.
    //
    // The HTTP/2 spec disallows recursive pushes and cross-authority pushes.
    // Push may or may not detect these invalid pushes; however, invalid
    // pushes will be detected and canceled by conforming clients.
    //
    // Handlers that wish to push URL X should call Push before sending any
    // data that may trigger a request for URL X. This avoids a race where the
    // client issues requests for X before receiving the PUSH_PROMISE for X.
    //
    // Push will run in a separate goroutine making the order of arrival

    // by the client.
    //
    // For client requests, Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
    // the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
    // values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
    // After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
    // the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
    // not mutate Trailer.
    //
    // Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
    Trailer Header

    // RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
    // the network address that sent the request, usually for
    // logging. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest and
    // has no defined format. The HTTP server in this package
    // sets RemoteAddr to an "IP:port" address before invoking a
    // handler.
    // This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
    RemoteAddr string

    // RequestURI is the unmodified request-target of the
    // Request-Line (RFC 7230, Section 3.1.1) as sent by the client
    // to a server. Usually the URL field should be used instead.
    // It is an error to set this field in an HTTP client request.
    RequestURI string

    // TLS allows HTTP servers and other software to record
    // information about the TLS connection on which the request
    // was received. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest.
    // The HTTP server in this package sets the field for
    // TLS-enabled connections before invoking a handler;
    // otherwise it leaves the field nil.
    // This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
    TLS *tls.ConnectionState

    // Cancel is an optional channel whose closure indicates that the client
    // request should be regarded as canceled. Not all implementations of
    // RoundTripper may support Cancel.
    //
    // For server requests, this field is not applicable.
    //
    // Deprecated: Set the Request's context with NewRequestWithContext
    // instead. If a Request's Cancel field and context are both
    // set, it is undefined whether Cancel is respected.
    Cancel <-chan struct{}

    // Response is the redirect response which caused this request
    // to be created. This field is only populated during client
    // redirects.
    Response *Response
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}

```
A Request represents an HTTP request received by a server
or to be sent by a client.

The field semantics differ slightly between client and server
usage. In addition to the notes on the fields below, see the
documentation for Request.Write and RoundTripper.

### <a name="NewRequest">func</a> [NewRequest](./request.go#L812)
``` go
func NewRequest(method, url string, body io.Reader) (*Request, error)
```
NewRequest wraps NewRequestWithContext using the background context.

### <a name="NewRequestWithContext">func</a> [NewRequestWithContext](./request.go#L838)
``` go
func NewRequestWithContext(ctx context.Context, method, url string, body io.Reader) (*Request, error)
```
NewRequestWithContext returns a new Request given a method, URL, and
optional body.

If the provided body is also an io.Closer, the returned
Request.Body is set to body and will be closed by the Client
methods Do, Post, and PostForm, and Transport.RoundTrip.

NewRequestWithContext returns a Request suitable for use with
Client.Do or Transport.RoundTrip. To create a request for use with
testing a Server Handler, either use the NewRequest function in the
net/http/httptest package, use ReadRequest, or manually update the
Request fields. For an outgoing client request, the context
controls the entire lifetime of a request and its response:
obtaining a connection, sending the request, and reading the
response headers and body. See the Request type's documentation for
the difference between inbound and outbound request fields.

If body is of type *bytes.Buffer, *bytes.Reader, or
*strings.Reader, the returned request's ContentLength is set to its
exact value (instead of -1), GetBody is populated (so 307 and 308
redirects can replay the body), and Body is set to NoBody if the
ContentLength is 0.

### <a name="ReadRequest">func</a> [ReadRequest](./request.go#L996)
``` go
func ReadRequest(b *bufio.Reader) (*Request, error)
```
ReadRequest reads and parses an incoming request from b.

ReadRequest is a low-level function and should only be used for
specialized applications; most code should use the Server to read
requests and handle them via the Handler interface. ReadRequest
only supports HTTP/1.x requests. For HTTP/2, use golang.org/x/net/http2.

### <a name="Request.AddCookie">func</a> (\*Request) [AddCookie](./request.go#L430)
``` go
func (r *Request) AddCookie(c *Cookie)
```
AddCookie adds a cookie to the request. Per RFC 6265 section 5.4,
AddCookie does not attach more than one Cookie header field. That
means all cookies, if any, are written into the same line,
separated by semicolon.

### <a name="Request.BasicAuth">func</a> (\*Request) [BasicAuth](./request.go#L922)
``` go
func (r *Request) BasicAuth() (username, password string, ok bool)
```
BasicAuth returns the username and password provided in the request's
Authorization header, if the request uses HTTP Basic Authentication.
See RFC 2617, Section 2.

### <a name="Request.Clone">func</a> (\*Request) [Clone](./request.go#L370)
``` go
func (r *Request) Clone(ctx context.Context) *Request
```
Clone returns a deep copy of r with its context changed to ctx.
The provided ctx must be non-nil.

For an outgoing client request, the context controls the entire
lifetime of a request and its response: obtaining a connection,
sending the request, and reading the response headers and body.

### <a name="Request.Context">func</a> (\*Request) [Context](./request.go#L335)
``` go
func (r *Request) Context() context.Context
```
Context returns the request's context. To change the context, use
WithContext.

The returned context is always non-nil; it defaults to the
background context.

For outgoing client requests, the context controls cancellation.

For incoming server requests, the context is canceled when the
client's connection closes, the request is canceled (with HTTP/2),
or when the ServeHTTP method returns.

### <a name="Request.Cookie">func</a> (\*Request) [Cookie](./request.go#L419)
``` go
func (r *Request) Cookie(name string) (*Cookie, error)
```
Cookie returns the named cookie provided in the request or
ErrNoCookie if not found.
If multiple cookies match the given name, only one cookie will
be returned.

### <a name="Request.Cookies">func</a> (\*Request) [Cookies](./request.go#L408)
``` go
func (r *Request) Cookies() []*Cookie
```
Cookies parses and returns the HTTP cookies sent with the request.

### <a name="Request.FormFile">func</a> (\*Request) [FormFile](./request.go#L1351)
``` go
func (r *Request) FormFile(key string) (multipart.File, *multipart.FileHeader, error)
```
FormFile returns the first file for the provided form key.
FormFile calls ParseMultipartForm and ParseForm if necessary.

### <a name="Request.FormValue">func</a> (\*Request) [FormValue](./request.go#L1324)
``` go
func (r *Request) FormValue(key string) string
```
FormValue returns the first value for the named component of the query.
POST and PUT body parameters take precedence over URL query string values.
FormValue calls ParseMultipartForm and ParseForm if necessary and ignores
any errors returned by these functions.
If key is not present, FormValue returns the empty string.
To access multiple values of the same key, call ParseForm and
then inspect Request.Form directly.

### <a name="Request.MultipartReader">func</a> (\*Request) [MultipartReader](./request.go#L463)
``` go
func (r *Request) MultipartReader() (*multipart.Reader, error)
```
MultipartReader returns a MIME multipart reader if this is a
multipart/form-data or a multipart/mixed POST request, else returns nil and an error.
Use this function instead of ParseMultipartForm to
process the request body as a stream.

### <a name="Request.ParseForm">func</a> (\*Request) [ParseForm](./request.go#L1238)
``` go
func (r *Request) ParseForm() error
```
ParseForm populates r.Form and r.PostForm.

For all requests, ParseForm parses the raw query from the URL and updates
r.Form.

For POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, it also parses the request body as a form
and puts the results into both r.PostForm and r.Form. Request body parameters
take precedence over URL query string values in r.Form.

For other HTTP methods, or when the Content-Type is not
application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the request Body is not read, and
r.PostForm is initialized to a non-nil, empty value.

If the request Body's size has not already been limited by MaxBytesReader,
the size is capped at 10MB.

ParseMultipartForm calls ParseForm automatically.
ParseForm is idempotent.

### <a name="Request.ParseMultipartForm">func</a> (\*Request) [ParseMultipartForm](./request.go#L1279)
``` go
func (r *Request) ParseMultipartForm(maxMemory int64) error
```
ParseMultipartForm parses a request body as multipart/form-data.
The whole request body is parsed and up to a total of maxMemory bytes of
its file parts are stored in memory, with the remainder stored on
disk in temporary files.
ParseMultipartForm calls ParseForm if necessary.
After one call to ParseMultipartForm, subsequent calls have no effect.

### <a name="Request.PostFormValue">func</a> (\*Request) [PostFormValue](./request.go#L1339)
``` go
func (r *Request) PostFormValue(key string) string
```
PostFormValue returns the first value for the named component of the POST,
PATCH, or PUT request body. URL query parameters are ignored.
PostFormValue calls ParseMultipartForm and ParseForm if necessary and ignores
any errors returned by these functions.
If key is not present, PostFormValue returns the empty string.

### <a name="Request.ProtoAtLeast">func</a> (\*Request) [ProtoAtLeast](./request.go#L397)
``` go
func (r *Request) ProtoAtLeast(major, minor int) bool
```
ProtoAtLeast reports whether the HTTP protocol used
in the request is at least major.minor.

### <a name="Request.Referer">func</a> (\*Request) [Referer](./request.go#L447)
``` go
func (r *Request) Referer() string
```
Referer returns the referring URL, if sent in the request.

Referer is misspelled as in the request itself, a mistake from the
earliest days of HTTP.  This value can also be fetched from the
Header map as Header["Referer"]; the benefit of making it available
as a method is that the compiler can diagnose programs that use the
alternate (correct English) spelling req.Referrer() but cannot
diagnose programs that use Header["Referrer"].

### <a name="Request.SetBasicAuth">func</a> (\*Request) [SetBasicAuth](./request.go#L959)
``` go
func (r *Request) SetBasicAuth(username, password string)
```
SetBasicAuth sets the request's Authorization header to use HTTP
Basic Authentication with the provided username and password.

With HTTP Basic Authentication the provided username and password
are not encrypted.

Some protocols may impose additional requirements on pre-escaping the
username and password. For instance, when used with OAuth2, both arguments
must be URL encoded first with url.QueryEscape.

### <a name="Request.UserAgent">func</a> (\*Request) [UserAgent](./request.go#L403)
``` go
func (r *Request) UserAgent() string
```
UserAgent returns the client's User-Agent, if sent in the request.

### <a name="Request.WithContext">func</a> (\*Request) [WithContext](./request.go#L353)
``` go
func (r *Request) WithContext(ctx context.Context) *Request
```
WithContext returns a shallow copy of r with its context changed
to ctx. The provided ctx must be non-nil.

For outgoing client request, the context controls the entire
lifetime of a request and its response: obtaining a connection,
sending the request, and reading the response headers and body.

To create a new request with a context, use NewRequestWithContext.
To change the context of a request (such as an incoming) you then
also want to modify to send back out, use Request.Clone. Between
those two uses, it's rare to need WithContext.

### <a name="Request.Write">func</a> (\*Request) [Write](./request.go#L523)
``` go
func (r *Request) Write(w io.Writer) error
```
Write writes an HTTP/1.1 request, which is the header and body, in wire format.
This method consults the following fields of the request:

	Host
	URL
	Method (defaults to "GET")
	Header
	ContentLength
	TransferEncoding
	Body

If Body is present, Content-Length is <= 0 and TransferEncoding
hasn't been set to "identity", Write adds "Transfer-Encoding:
chunked" to the header. Body is closed after it is sent.

### <a name="Request.WriteProxy">func</a> (\*Request) [WriteProxy](./request.go#L533)
``` go
func (r *Request) WriteProxy(w io.Writer) error
```
WriteProxy is like Write but writes the request in the form
expected by an HTTP proxy. In particular, WriteProxy writes the
initial Request-URI line of the request with an absolute URI, per
section 5.3 of RFC 7230, including the scheme and host.
In either case, WriteProxy also writes a Host header, using
either r.Host or r.URL.Host.

## <a name="Response">type</a> [Response](./response.go#L35-L122)
``` go
type Response struct {
    Status     string // e.g. "200 OK"
    StatusCode int    // e.g. 200
    Proto      string // e.g. "HTTP/1.0"
    ProtoMajor int    // e.g. 1
    ProtoMinor int    // e.g. 0

    // Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
    // headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
    // delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
    // be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
    // Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
    // ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
    // authoritative.
    //
    // Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).
    Header Header

    // Body represents the response body.
    //
    // The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
    // is read. If the network connection fails or the server
    // terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
    //
    // The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
    // non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
    // a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
    // close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
    // reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
    // not read to completion and closed.
    //
    // The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
    // with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
    //
    // As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
    // on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
    // as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
    Body io.ReadCloser

    // ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
    // value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
    // is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
    // be read from Body.
    ContentLength int64

    // Contains transfer encodings from outer-most to inner-most. Value is
    // nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.
    TransferEncoding []string

    // Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
    // closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
    // ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
    Close bool

    // Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
    // was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
    // Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
    // content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
    // and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
    // from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
    // the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.
    Uncompressed bool

    // Trailer maps trailer keys to values in the same
    // format as Header.
    //
    // The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
    // each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
    // value. Those values are not added to Header.
    //
    // Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
    // on the Body.
    //
    // After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
    // any trailer values sent by the server.
    Trailer Header

    // Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
    // Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
    // This is only populated for Client requests.
    Request *Request

    // TLS contains information about the TLS connection on which the
    // response was received. It is nil for unencrypted responses.
    // The pointer is shared between responses and should not be
    // modified.
    TLS *tls.ConnectionState
}

```
Response represents the response from an HTTP request.

The Client and Transport return Responses from servers once
the response headers have been received. The response body
is streamed on demand as the Body field is read.

### <a name="Get">func</a> [Get](./client.go#L369)
``` go
func Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of
the following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect, up to a
maximum of 10 redirects:

	301 (Moved Permanently)
	302 (Found)
	303 (See Other)
	307 (Temporary Redirect)
	308 (Permanent Redirect)

An error is returned if there were too many redirects or if there
was an HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't cause an
error. Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error
value's Timeout method will report true if request timed out or was
canceled.

When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

Get is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Get.

To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and
DefaultClient.Do.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
res, err := http.Get("http://www.google.com/robots.txt")
	if err != nil {
	    log.Fatal(err)
	}
	robots, err := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
	res.Body.Close()
	if err != nil {
	    log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%s", robots)
```

</details>
### <a name="Head">func</a> [Head](./client.go#L815)
``` go
func Head(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Head issues a HEAD to the specified URL. If the response is one of
the following redirect codes, Head follows the redirect, up to a
maximum of 10 redirects:

	301 (Moved Permanently)
	302 (Found)
	303 (See Other)
	307 (Temporary Redirect)
	308 (Permanent Redirect)

Head is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Head

### <a name="Post">func</a> [Post](./client.go#L748)
``` go
func Post(url, contentType string, body io.Reader) (resp *Response, err error)
```
Post issues a POST to the specified URL.

Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

If the provided body is an io.Closer, it is closed after the
request.

Post is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Post.

To set custom headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects
are handled.

### <a name="PostForm">func</a> [PostForm](./client.go#L785)
``` go
func PostForm(url string, data url.Values) (resp *Response, err error)
```
PostForm issues a POST to the specified URL, with data's keys and
values URL-encoded as the request body.

The Content-Type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
To set other headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.

PostForm is a wrapper around DefaultClient.PostForm.

See the Client.Do method documentation for details on how redirects
are handled.

### <a name="ReadResponse">func</a> [ReadResponse](./response.go#L154)
``` go
func ReadResponse(r *bufio.Reader, req *Request) (*Response, error)
```
ReadResponse reads and returns an HTTP response from r.
The req parameter optionally specifies the Request that corresponds
to this Response. If nil, a GET request is assumed.
Clients must call resp.Body.Close when finished reading resp.Body.
After that call, clients can inspect resp.Trailer to find key/value
pairs included in the response trailer.

### <a name="Response.Cookies">func</a> (\*Response) [Cookies](./response.go#L125)
``` go
func (r *Response) Cookies() []*Cookie
```
Cookies parses and returns the cookies set in the Set-Cookie headers.

### <a name="Response.Location">func</a> (\*Response) [Location](./response.go#L137)
``` go
func (r *Response) Location() (*url.URL, error)
```
Location returns the URL of the response's "Location" header,
if present. Relative redirects are resolved relative to
the Response's Request. ErrNoLocation is returned if no
Location header is present.

### <a name="Response.ProtoAtLeast">func</a> (\*Response) [ProtoAtLeast](./response.go#L224)
``` go
func (r *Response) ProtoAtLeast(major, minor int) bool
```
ProtoAtLeast reports whether the HTTP protocol used
in the response is at least major.minor.

### <a name="Response.Write">func</a> (\*Response) [Write](./response.go#L245)
``` go
func (r *Response) Write(w io.Writer) error
```
Write writes r to w in the HTTP/1.x server response format,
including the status line, headers, body, and optional trailer.

This method consults the following fields of the response r:

	StatusCode
	ProtoMajor
	ProtoMinor
	Request.Method
	TransferEncoding
	Trailer
	Body
	ContentLength
	Header, values for non-canonical keys will have unpredictable behavior

The Response Body is closed after it is sent.

## <a name="ResponseWriter">type</a> [ResponseWriter](./server.go#L94-L154)
``` go
type ResponseWriter interface {
    // Header returns the header map that will be sent by
    // WriteHeader. The Header map also is the mechanism with which
    // Handlers can set HTTP trailers.
    //
    // Changing the header map after a call to WriteHeader (or
    // Write) has no effect unless the modified headers are
    // trailers.
    //
    // There are two ways to set Trailers. The preferred way is to
    // predeclare in the headers which trailers you will later
    // send by setting the "Trailer" header to the names of the
    // trailer keys which will come later. In this case, those
    // keys of the Header map are treated as if they were
    // trailers. See the example. The second way, for trailer
    // keys not known to the Handler until after the first Write,
    // is to prefix the Header map keys with the TrailerPrefix
    // constant value. See TrailerPrefix.
    //
    // To suppress automatic response headers (such as "Date"), set
    // their value to nil.
    Header() Header

    // Write writes the data to the connection as part of an HTTP reply.
    //
    // If WriteHeader has not yet been called, Write calls
    // WriteHeader(http.StatusOK) before writing the data. If the Header
    // does not contain a Content-Type line, Write adds a Content-Type set
    // to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to
    // DetectContentType. Additionally, if the total size of all written
    // data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls, the
    // Content-Length header is added automatically.
    //
    // Depending on the HTTP protocol version and the client, calling
    // Write or WriteHeader may prevent future reads on the
    // Request.Body. For HTTP/1.x requests, handlers should read any
    // needed request body data before writing the response. Once the
    // headers have been flushed (due to either an explicit Flusher.Flush
    // call or writing enough data to trigger a flush), the request body
    // may be unavailable. For HTTP/2 requests, the Go HTTP server permits
    // handlers to continue to read the request body while concurrently
    // writing the response. However, such behavior may not be supported
    // by all HTTP/2 clients. Handlers should read before writing if
    // possible to maximize compatibility.
    Write([]byte) (int, error)

    // WriteHeader sends an HTTP response header with the provided
    // status code.
    //
    // If WriteHeader is not called explicitly, the first call to Write
    // will trigger an implicit WriteHeader(http.StatusOK).
    // Thus explicit calls to WriteHeader are mainly used to
    // send error codes.
    //
    // The provided code must be a valid HTTP 1xx-5xx status code.
    // Only one header may be written. Go does not currently
    // support sending user-defined 1xx informational headers,
    // with the exception of 100-continue response header that the
    // Server sends automatically when the Request.Body is read.
    WriteHeader(statusCode int)
}
```
A ResponseWriter interface is used by an HTTP handler to
construct an HTTP response.

A ResponseWriter may not be used after the Handler.ServeHTTP method
has returned.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("/sendstrailers", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	    // Before any call to WriteHeader or Write, declare
	    // the trailers you will set during the HTTP
	    // response. These three headers are actually sent in
	    // the trailer.
	    w.Header().Set("Trailer", "AtEnd1, AtEnd2")
	    w.Header().Add("Trailer", "AtEnd3")
	
	    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8") // normal header
	    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	
	    w.Header().Set("AtEnd1", "value 1")
	    io.WriteString(w, "This HTTP response has both headers before this text and trailers at the end.\n")
	    w.Header().Set("AtEnd2", "value 2")
	    w.Header().Set("AtEnd3", "value 3") // These will appear as trailers.
	})
```

</details>

## <a name="RoundTripper">type</a> [RoundTripper](./client.go#L115-L141)
``` go
type RoundTripper interface {
    // RoundTrip executes a single HTTP transaction, returning
    // a Response for the provided Request.
    //
    // RoundTrip should not attempt to interpret the response. In
    // particular, RoundTrip must return err == nil if it obtained
    // a response, regardless of the response's HTTP status code.
    // A non-nil err should be reserved for failure to obtain a
    // response. Similarly, RoundTrip should not attempt to
    // handle higher-level protocol details such as redirects,
    // authentication, or cookies.
    //
    // RoundTrip should not modify the request, except for
    // consuming and closing the Request's Body. RoundTrip may
    // read fields of the request in a separate goroutine. Callers
    // should not mutate or reuse the request until the Response's
    // Body has been closed.
    //
    // RoundTrip must always close the body, including on errors,
    // but depending on the implementation may do so in a separate
    // goroutine even after RoundTrip returns. This means that
    // callers wanting to reuse the body for subsequent requests
    // must arrange to wait for the Close call before doing so.
    //
    // The Request's URL and Header fields must be initialized.
    RoundTrip(*Request) (*Response, error)
}
```
RoundTripper is an interface representing the ability to execute a
single HTTP transaction, obtaining the Response for a given Request.

A RoundTripper must be safe for concurrent use by multiple
goroutines.

``` go
var DefaultTransport RoundTripper = &Transport{
    Proxy: ProxyFromEnvironment,
    DialContext: (&net.Dialer{
        Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
        KeepAlive: 30 * time.Second,
        DualStack: true,
    }).DialContext,
    ForceAttemptHTTP2:     true,
    MaxIdleConns:          100,
    IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
    TLSHandshakeTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
    ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
}
```
DefaultTransport is the default implementation of Transport and is
used by DefaultClient. It establishes network connections as needed
and caches them for reuse by subsequent calls. It uses HTTP proxies
as directed by the $HTTP_PROXY and $NO_PROXY (or $http_proxy and
$no_proxy) environment variables.

### <a name="NewFileTransport">func</a> [NewFileTransport](./filetransport.go#L30)
``` go
func NewFileTransport(fs FileSystem) RoundTripper
```
NewFileTransport returns a new RoundTripper, serving the provided
FileSystem. The returned RoundTripper ignores the URL host in its
incoming requests, as well as most other properties of the
request.

The typical use case for NewFileTransport is to register the "file"
protocol with a Transport, as in:

	t := &http.Transport{}
	t.RegisterProtocol("file", http.NewFileTransport(http.Dir("/")))
	c := &http.Client{Transport: t}
	res, err := c.Get("file:///etc/passwd")
	...

## <a name="SameSite">type</a> [SameSite](./cookie.go#L45)
``` go
type SameSite int
```
SameSite allows a server to define a cookie attribute making it impossible for
the browser to send this cookie along with cross-site requests. The main
goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage, and provide
some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.

See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-same-site-00</a> for details.

``` go
const (
    SameSiteDefaultMode SameSite = iota + 1
    SameSiteLaxMode
    SameSiteStrictMode
    SameSiteNoneMode
)
```

## <a name="ServeMux">type</a> [ServeMux](./server.go#L2192-L2197)
``` go
type ServeMux struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}

```
ServeMux is an HTTP request multiplexer.
It matches the URL of each incoming request against a list of registered
patterns and calls the handler for the pattern that
most closely matches the URL.

Patterns name fixed, rooted paths, like "/favicon.ico",
or rooted subtrees, like "/images/" (note the trailing slash).
Longer patterns take precedence over shorter ones, so that
if there are handlers registered for both "/images/"
and "/images/thumbnails/", the latter handler will be
called for paths beginning "/images/thumbnails/" and the
former will receive requests for any other paths in the
"/images/" subtree.

Note that since a pattern ending in a slash names a rooted subtree,
the pattern "/" matches all paths not matched by other registered
patterns, not just the URL with Path == "/".

If a subtree has been registered and a request is received naming the
subtree root without its trailing slash, ServeMux redirects that
request to the subtree root (adding the trailing slash). This behavior can
be overridden with a separate registration for the path without
the trailing slash. For example, registering "/images/" causes ServeMux
to redirect a request for "/images" to "/images/", unless "/images" has
been registered separately.

Patterns may optionally begin with a host name, restricting matches to
URLs on that host only. Host-specific patterns take precedence over
general patterns, so that a handler might register for the two patterns
"/codesearch" and "codesearch.google.com/" without also taking over
requests for "<a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>".

ServeMux also takes care of sanitizing the URL request path and the Host
header, stripping the port number and redirecting any request containing . or
.. elements or repeated slashes to an equivalent, cleaner URL.

### <a name="NewServeMux">func</a> [NewServeMux](./server.go#L2205)
``` go
func NewServeMux() *ServeMux
```
NewServeMux allocates and returns a new ServeMux.

### <a name="ServeMux.Handle">func</a> (\*ServeMux) [Handle](./server.go#L2392)
``` go
func (mux *ServeMux) Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)
```
Handle registers the handler for the given pattern.
If a handler already exists for pattern, Handle panics.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand code.</summary>

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.Handle("/api/", apiHandler{})
	mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	    // The "/" pattern matches everything, so we need to check
	    // that we're at the root here.
	    if req.URL.Path != "/" {
	        http.NotFound(w, req)
	        return
	    }
	    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the home page!")
	})
```

</details>

### <a name="ServeMux.HandleFunc">func</a> (\*ServeMux) [HandleFunc](./server.go#L2436)
``` go
func (mux *ServeMux) HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
```
HandleFunc registers the handler function for the given pattern.

### <a name="ServeMux.Handler">func</a> (\*ServeMux) [Handler](./server.go#L2322)
``` go
func (mux *ServeMux) Handler(r *Request) (h Handler, pattern string)
```
Handler returns the handler to use for the given request,
consulting r.Method, r.Host, and r.URL.Path. It always returns
a non-nil handler. If the path is not in its canonical form, the
handler will be an internally-generated handler that redirects
to the canonical path. If the host contains a port, it is ignored
when matching handlers.

The path and host are used unchanged for CONNECT requests.

Handler also returns the registered pattern that matches the
request or, in the case of internally-generated redirects,
the pattern that will match after following the redirect.

If there is no registered handler that applies to the request,
Handler returns a ``page not found'' handler and an empty pattern.

### <a name="ServeMux.ServeHTTP">func</a> (\*ServeMux) [ServeHTTP](./server.go#L2378)
``` go
func (mux *ServeMux) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
```
ServeHTTP dispatches the request to the handler whose
pattern most closely matches the request URL.

## <a name="Server">type</a> [Server](./server.go#L2490-L2585)
``` go
type Server struct {
    Addr    string  // TCP address to listen on, ":http" if empty
    Handler Handler // handler to invoke, http.DefaultServeMux if nil

    // TLSConfig optionally provides a TLS configuration for use
    // by ServeTLS and ListenAndServeTLS. Note that this value is
    // cloned by ServeTLS and ListenAndServeTLS, so it's not
    // possible to modify the configuration with methods like
    // tls.Config.SetSessionTicketKeys. To use
    // SetSessionTicketKeys, use Server.Serve with a TLS Listener
    // instead.
    TLSConfig *tls.Config

    // ReadTimeout is the maximum duration for reading the entire
    // request, including the body.
    //
    // Because ReadTimeout does not let Handlers make per-request
    // decisions on each request body's acceptable deadline or
    // upload rate, most users will prefer to use
    // ReadHeaderTimeout. It is valid to use them both.
    ReadTimeout time.Duration

    // ReadHeaderTimeout is the amount of time allowed to read
    // request headers. The connection's read deadline is reset
    // after reading the headers and the Handler can decide what
    // is considered too slow for the body. If ReadHeaderTimeout
    // is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are
    // zero, there is no timeout.
    ReadHeaderTimeout time.Duration

    // WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out
    // writes of the response. It is reset whenever a new
    // request's header is read. Like ReadTimeout, it does not
    // let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
    WriteTimeout time.Duration

    // IdleTimeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the
    // next request when keep-alives are enabled. If IdleTimeout
    // is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are
    // zero, there is no timeout.
    IdleTimeout time.Duration

    // MaxHeaderBytes controls the maximum number of bytes the
    // server will read parsing the request header's keys and
    // values, including the request line. It does not limit the
    // size of the request body.
    // If zero, DefaultMaxHeaderBytes is used.
    MaxHeaderBytes int

    // TLSNextProto optionally specifies a function to take over
    // ownership of the provided TLS connection when an NPN/ALPN
    // protocol upgrade has occurred. The map key is the protocol
    // name negotiated. The Handler argument should be used to

    // automatically closed when the function returns.
    // If TLSNextProto is not nil, HTTP/2 support is not enabled
    // automatically.
    TLSNextProto map[string]func(*Server, *tls.Conn, Handler)

    // ConnState specifies an optional callback function that is
    // called when a client connection changes state. See the
    // ConnState type and associated constants for details.
    ConnState func(net.Conn, ConnState)

    // ErrorLog specifies an optional logger for errors accepting
    // connections, unexpected behavior from handlers, and
    // underlying FileSystem errors.
    // If nil, logging is done via the log package's standard logger.
    ErrorLog *log.Logger

    // BaseContext optionally specifies a function that returns
    // the base context for incoming requests on this server.
    // The provided Listener is the specific Listener that's
    // about to start accepting requests.
    // If BaseContext is nil, the default is context.Background().
    // If non-nil, it must return a non-nil context.
    BaseContext func(net.Listener) context.Context

    // ConnContext optionally specifies a function that modifies
    // the context used for a new connection c. The provided ctx
    // is derived from the base context and has a ServerContextKey
    // value.
    ConnContext func(ctx context.Context, c net.Conn) context.Context
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}

```
A Server defines parameters for running an HTTP server.
The zero value for Server is a valid configuration.

### <a name="Server.Close">func</a> (\*Server) [Close](./server.go#L2621)
``` go
func (srv *Server) Close() error
```
Close immediately closes all active net.Listeners and any
connections in state StateNew, StateActive, or StateIdle. For a
graceful shutdown, use Shutdown.

Close does not attempt to close (and does not even know about)
any hijacked connections, such as WebSockets.

Close returns any error returned from closing the Server's
underlying Listener(s).

### <a name="Server.ListenAndServe">func</a> (\*Server) [ListenAndServe](./server.go#L2813)
``` go
func (srv *Server) ListenAndServe() error
```
ListenAndServe listens on the TCP network address srv.Addr and then
calls Serve to handle requests on incoming connections.
Accepted connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

If srv.Addr is blank, ":http" is used.

ListenAndServe always returns a non-nil error. After Shutdown or Close,
the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

### <a name="Server.ListenAndServeTLS">func</a> (\*Server) [ListenAndServeTLS](./server.go#L3108)
``` go
func (srv *Server) ListenAndServeTLS(certFile, keyFile string) error
```
ListenAndServeTLS listens on the TCP network address srv.Addr and
then calls ServeTLS to handle requests on incoming TLS connections.
Accepted connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives.

Filenames containing a certificate and matching private key for the
server must be provided if neither the Server's TLSConfig.Certificates
nor TLSConfig.GetCertificate are populated. If the certificate is
signed by a certificate authority, the certFile should be the
concatenation of the server's certificate, any intermediates, and
the CA's certificate.

If srv.Addr is blank, ":https" is used.

ListenAndServeTLS always returns a non-nil error. After Shutdown or
Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

### <a name="Server.RegisterOnShutdown">func</a> (\*Server) [RegisterOnShutdown](./server.go#L2693)
``` go
func (srv *Server) RegisterOnShutdown(f func())
```
RegisterOnShutdown registers a function to call on Shutdown.
This can be used to gracefully shutdown connections that have
undergone NPN/ALPN protocol upgrade or that have been hijacked.
This function should start protocol-specific graceful shutdown,
but should not wait for shutdown to complete.

### <a name="Server.Serve">func</a> (\*Server) [Serve](./server.go#L2866)
``` go
func (srv *Server) Serve(l net.Listener) error
```
Serve accepts incoming connections on the Listener l, creating a
new service goroutine for each. The service goroutines read requests and
then call srv.Handler to reply to them.

HTTP/2 support is only enabled if the Listener returns *tls.Conn
connections and they were configured with "h2" in the TLS
Config.NextProtos.

Serve always returns a non-nil error and closes l.
After Shutdown or Close, the returned error is ErrServerClosed.

### <a name="Server.ServeTLS">func</a> (\*Server) [ServeTLS](./server.go#L2944)
``` go
func (srv *Server) ServeTLS(l net.Listener, certFile, keyFile string) error
```
ServeTLS accepts incoming connections on the Listener l, creating a
new service goroutine for each. The service goroutines perform TLS
setup and then read requests, calling srv.Handler to reply to them.

Files containing a certificate and matching private key for the
server must be provided if neither the Server's
TLSConfig.Certificates nor TLSConfig.GetCertificate are populated.
If the certificate is signed by a certificate authority, the
certFile should be the concatenation of the server's certificate,
any intermediates, and the CA's certificate.

ServeTLS always returns a non-nil error. After Shutdown or Close, the
returned error is ErrServerClosed.

### <a name="Server.SetKeepAlivesEnabled">func</a> (\*Server) [SetKeepAlivesEnabled](./server.go#L3038)
``` go
func (srv *Server) SetKeepAlivesEnabled(v bool)
```
SetKeepAlivesEnabled controls whether HTTP keep-alives are enabled.
By default, keep-alives are always enabled. Only very
resource-constrained environments or servers in the process of
shutting down should disable them.

### <a name="Server.Shutdown">func</a> (\*Server) [Shutdown](./server.go#L2663)
``` go
func (srv *Server) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
```
Shutdown gracefully shuts down the server without interrupting any
active connections. Shutdown works by first closing all open
listeners, then closing all idle connections, and then waiting
indefinitely for connections to return to idle and then shut down.
If the provided context expires before the shutdown is complete,
Shutdown returns the context's error, otherwise it returns any
error returned from closing the Server's underlying Listener(s).

When Shutdown is called, Serve, ListenAndServe, and
ListenAndServeTLS immediately return ErrServerClosed. Make sure the
program doesn't exit and waits instead for Shutdown to return.

Shutdown does not attempt to close nor wait for hijacked
connections such as WebSockets. The caller of Shutdown should
separately notify such long-lived connections of shutdown and wait
for them to close, if desired. See RegisterOnShutdown for a way to
register shutdown notification functions.

Once Shutdown has been called on a server, it may not be reused;
future calls to methods such as Serve will return ErrServerClosed.

```go
var srv http.Server
	
	idleConnsClosed := make(chan struct{})
	go func() {
	    sigint := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	    signal.Notify(sigint, os.Interrupt)
	    <-sigint
	
	    // We received an interrupt signal, shut down.
	    if err := srv.Shutdown(context.Background()); err != nil {
	        // Error from closing listeners, or context timeout:
	        log.Printf("HTTP server Shutdown: %v", err)
	    }
	    close(idleConnsClosed)
	}()
	
	if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != http.ErrServerClosed {
	    // Error starting or closing listener:
	    log.Fatalf("HTTP server ListenAndServe: %v", err)

```
Transport is an implementation of RoundTripper that supports HTTP,
HTTPS, and HTTP proxies (for either HTTP or HTTPS with CONNECT).

By default, Transport caches connections for future re-use.
This may leave many open connections when accessing many hosts.
This behavior can be managed using Transport's CloseIdleConnections method
and the MaxIdleConnsPerHost and DisableKeepAlives fields.

Transports should be reused instead of created as needed.
Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

A Transport is a low-level primitive for making HTTP and HTTPS requests.
For high-level functionality, such as cookies and redirects, see Client.

Transport uses HTTP/1.1 for HTTP URLs and either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2
for HTTPS URLs, depending on whether the server supports HTTP/2,
and how the Transport is configured. The DefaultTransport supports HTTP/2.
To explicitly enable HTTP/2 on a transport, use golang.org/x/net/http2
and call ConfigureTransport. See the package docs for more about HTTP/2.

Responses with status codes in the 1xx range are either handled
automatically (100 expect-continue) or ignored. The one
exception is HTTP status code 101 (Switching Protocols), which is
considered a terminal status and returned by RoundTrip. To see the
ignored 1xx responses, use the httptrace trace package's
ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse.

Transport only retries a request upon encountering a network error
if the request is idempotent and either has no body or has its
Request.GetBody defined. HTTP requests are considered idempotent if
they have HTTP methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, or TRACE; or if their
Header map contains an "Idempotency-Key" or "X-Idempotency-Key"
entry. If the idempotency key value is an zero-length slice, the
request is treated as idempotent but the header is not sent on the
wire.

### <a name="Transport.CancelRequest">func</a> (\*Transport) [CancelRequest](./transport.go#L671)
``` go
func (t *Transport) CancelRequest(req *Request)
```
CancelRequest cancels an in-flight request by closing its connection.
CancelRequest should only be called after RoundTrip has returned.

Deprecated: Use Request.WithContext to create a request with a
cancelable context instead. CancelRequest cannot cancel HTTP/2
requests.

### <a name="Transport.Clone">func</a> (\*Transport) [Clone](./transport.go#L282)
``` go
func (t *Transport) Clone() *Transport
```
Clone returns a deep copy of t's exported fields.

### <a name="Transport.CloseIdleConnections">func</a> (\*Transport) [CloseIdleConnections](./transport.go#L647)
``` go
func (t *Transport) CloseIdleConnections()
```
CloseIdleConnections closes any connections which were previously
connected from previous requests but are now sitting idle in
a "keep-alive" state. It does not interrupt any connections currently
in use.

### <a name="Transport.RegisterProtocol">func</a> (\*Transport) [RegisterProtocol](./transport.go#L628)
``` go
func (t *Transport) RegisterProtocol(scheme string, rt RoundTripper)
```
RegisterProtocol registers a new protocol with scheme.
The Transport will pass requests using the given scheme to rt.
It is rt's responsibility to simulate HTTP request semantics.

RegisterProtocol can be used by other packages to provide
implementations of protocol schemes like "ftp" or "file".

If rt.RoundTrip returns ErrSkipAltProtocol, the Transport will
handle the RoundTrip itself for that one request, as if the
protocol were not registered.

### <a name="Transport.RoundTrip">func</a> (\*Transport) [RoundTrip](./roundtrip.go#L16)
``` go
func (t *Transport) RoundTrip(req *Request) (*Response, error)
```
RoundTrip implements the RoundTripper interface.

For higher-level HTTP client support (such as handling of cookies
